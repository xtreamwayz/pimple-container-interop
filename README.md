# Pimple-container-interop

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xtreamwayz/pimple-container-interop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xtreamwayz/pimple-container-interop)

This container extends the Pimple 3 container. It also adds the *delegate lookup feature* from
[container-interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop).

## Usage

```php
use Xtreamwayz\Pimple\Container;

$container = new Container();
```

And now you can use all [Pimple features](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple), and also have the ``has`` and ``get``
functions from container-interop.

## Delegates

The delegate lookup feature allows several containers to share entries. It can perform dependency lookups in other
containers. They can be added with the ``delegate($container)`` function.

```php
$container = new Xtreamwayz\Pimple\Container;
$container['hi'] = 'welcome';

$delegate1 = new Acme\Container\DelegateContainer;
$delegate1['foo'] = 'bar';
$container->delegate($delegate1);

$delegate2 = new Xtreamwayz\Pimple\Container;
$delegate2['baz'] = 'qux';
$container->delegate($delegate2);

// Resolve dependency from main $container
$container->has('hi'); // true
$container->get('hi'); // returns 'welcome';

// Resolve dependency from $delegate1
$container->has('foo'); // true
$container->get('foo'); // returns 'bar';

// Resolve dependency from $delegate2
$container->has('baz'); // true
$container->get('baz'); // returns 'qux';
```

Once the delegate has been registered and a lookup is not resolved in the main container, it tries the ``has`` and
``get`` methods of each delegate in the order it was registered.
